## Notes

I spent a lot of time trying to get Xcode to work. I had a problem where Xcode would crash everytime I created a new project. After trying several posible solutions I ended up having to create a new virtual machine and using a diferent mac OS ISO than in the original one VM. Then while creating the app I had some compilation errors related to the "developement team ID". In conclusion I spent too much time fixing VM problems.
